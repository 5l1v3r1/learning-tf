# learning-tf

I am learning how to use [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org). This is the first Python ML library I have used. Up until now, I have only used my own ML packages, including [anynet](https://github.com/unixpickle/anynet).

# Motivation

I enjoy using Go and anynet, but I want to be able to read and contribute to open source deep learning projects. Since the majority of the community uses Python and TensorFlow/Keras/Theano, I want to learn those tools.
